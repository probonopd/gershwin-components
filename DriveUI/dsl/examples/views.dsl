# Sidebar visibility: the "View/Show Sidebar" item must toggle the sidebar of
# a browsing viewer (checked when showing, greyed out for spatial viewers) and
# the pane must actually vanish and return without losing the window.
#
# The sidebar exists only in browsing viewers, so the script switches the
# default viewer type to Browsing, verifies, then restores it to Spatial.
# Both switches pop a confirmation alert, which the script dismisses
# explicitly with `invoke default button`.  Runs on the home folder (like
# window_placement.dsl): the root disk's icon layout is too heavy for repeated
# view operations and can wedge the app.
#
# View-mode switching (as Icons/List/Columns) is exercised by navigation.dsl
# on spatial viewers; switching view modes inside a browsing viewer
# intermittently wedges the app (pre-existing Workspace issue).
#
# Leaves the computer as it was found: the default viewer type is restored,
# the sidebar is toggled off and back on, and the window is closed.
#
# Run with: drive_script examples/views.dsl

# Switch the default viewer type to Browsing so the folder opens with a
