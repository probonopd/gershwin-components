# Window placement stability: a folder viewer window must open at the same
# on-screen position every time.  Opens the home folder ("~") four times,
# asserting the window frame is identical on each open, then does the same for
# the root folder ("/").  Menu and window names are English; the engine
# localizes them via the app, so the script also runs on a German Workspace.
#
# Run with: drive_script examples/window_placement.dsl
