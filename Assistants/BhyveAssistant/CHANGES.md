### VNC Client Checking
- The assistant now checks for VNC clients in both common absolute paths and the system PATH
- If no VNC client is found, it navigates to an error page instead of showing a status message
- Supports both `/usr/local/bin/vncviewer`, `/usr/bin/vncviewer`, and `vncviewer` in PATH
- Provides helpful error messages guiding users to install VNC viewers

### Error Handling
- Added proper error page navigation for VNC-related issues
- Localized error messages for better user experience

## User Experience Changes

- Better error feedback when VNC clients are missing
- Cleaner, more focused workflow

## Technical Improvements
- Reduced memory footprint by removing unnecessary intro step
- Better separation of concerns for VNC functionality
- More robust error handling throughout the VNC workflow

## Testing

- No localization parsing errors
- Proper step navigation without intro step
- VNC client checking works correctly
