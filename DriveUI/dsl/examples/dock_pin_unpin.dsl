# Dock pin/unpin lifecycle: pin a running app, quit it, and verify the pinned
# icon STAYS in the Dock (that is what pinning buys: the icon survives the app
# quitting).  Then unpin and verify the icon is removed entirely, because the
# app is no longer running.  The Dock lives inside the Workspace app, so
# Workspace is the script's target whenever the context menu is involved.
#
# Run with: drive_script examples/dock_pin_unpin.dsl
launch application "Processes"
activate application "Workspace"
wait until icon "Processes"

# Self-healing start: if a previous run left Processes pinned, unpin it first.
if icon "Processes" docked
  context menu "Processes" "Remove from Dock"
  wait 500ms
end

# 1. Pin the running app to the Dock.
context menu "Processes" "Keep in Dock"
assert icon "Processes" docked

# 2. Quit the app - the pinned icon must remain in the Dock.
activate application "Processes"
select menu "Processes/Quit Processes"
wait until not exists window "Process monitor"
activate application "Workspace"
assert icon "Processes" docked

# 3. Unpin - with the app no longer running the icon is removed entirely.
context menu "Processes" "Remove from Dock"
wait until not exists icon "Processes"
assert not exists icon "Processes"

log "dock pin/unpin works"
