# Standard-folder navigation: the Go menu must open a viewer window for each
# of the standard locations.  Exercises the menu, window open, and window close
# paths.  Window titles are English; the engine localizes them (e.g. "Documents"
# becomes "Dokumente", "System Disk" becomes "Systemfestplatte").
#
# The Desktop folder is not tested: its window title ("Schreibtisch"/"Desktop")
# also matches the always-visible desktop window, so the close check cannot be
# expressed.  Downloads and Movies are skipped too: their localized folder
# names ("Heruntergeladen", "Videos") have no English mapping in the app.
#
# Leaves the computer as it was found: every window it opens is closed again.
#
# Run with: drive_script examples/navigation.dsl
