- Write GNUstep compatible code. Don't use features unavailable in GNUstep such as CoreFoundation, Grand Central Dispatch, etc.
- Use commands from `$PATH`, not hardcoded paths.
- Use `gmake`, not `make`.
- Avoid bashisms; use POSIX sh.
- Build the application until it works, even with multiple attempts.
- Use -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O2, fix all compiler warnings, regardless of severity.
- Use `sudo -A -E` for commands requiring root privileges.
- Compile with `clang19`, never `gcc`.
- Use extensive logging for debugging with NSLog.
- If you build a preference pane, test with `/System/Applications/SystemPreferences.app/SystemPreferences`.
- Refer to FreeBSD documentation and the porters handbook for building ports.
- Before running any shell commands, check which shell is being used.
- Remember that in one Terminal, you can only run one command at a time unless you use `&` to run it in the background.
- Always run commands with `timeout` to prevent hanging.
- If you run the same command multiple times, write an action to run it instead of repeating the command.
- We don't have `strace`, so use `truss` for tracing system calls.
- Use Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture where appropriate.
- Use KVO (Key-Value Observing) for observing changes in properties where needed.
- Always use a `GNUmakefile` to compile anything involving Foundation or GNUstep.
- Never "create a simple test to verify" anything. Verify using /System/Applications/LoginWindow.app or other system applications.
- For all UI elements, use 24px spacing from the window edges but 20 px from the top edge and at the bottom.
- Buttons are 24 px high and neighboring ones are 12 px apart from each other.
- Use `NSLocalizedString` for all user-facing strings to ensure they are localizable.
- Unless specifically asked to do so never write test cases; instead, use the existing real applications to verify functionality.
- NEVER write any .md or other summary files, unless specifically requested to do so. Never summarize successes.
- The GCD dispatch functions aren't available.
